	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.AE2": "&lWelcome to &bApplied Energistics 2&f! \\n \\n Applied Energistics 2 (or &oAE2&r for short) is an incredibly versatile &bdigital storage&f mod, allowing for extremely efficient storage and all sorts of automation capabilities to greatly augment your modded Minecraft experience from as early as you want to the very endgame. \\n \\n To get started with AE2, you will need to sieve for an important resource for the mod known as &bCertus Quartz&f. \\n \\n For more information on AE2 beyond this chapter, consult the wiki over at",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.wrench": "The &bQuartz Wrench&f does what any regular tech mod wrench would do. It rotates blocks and devices along the face you right-click on and dismantles them when right-clicked while sneaking. \\n \\n AE2's wrench comes in both certus and nether quartz flavours.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.first": "Two of the very first things you will need to get started in AE2 are the &bCharger&f and the &bInscriber&f. \\n \\n The &bCharger&f, when supplied with power, will take &eCertus Quartz Crystals&r and charge them. These &eCharged Certus Crystals&r can then be used in the production of &eFluix&f, another important resource in the mod. It can also be used to charge any item that stores power. \\n \\n The &bInscriber&f can be used to turn the various quartz crystals in AE2 into their dust form, but more importantly is used to fabricate special &ePrinted Circuits&f and &eProcessors&f, as will become clearer in the next quest.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_acceptor": "While the Inscriber and Charger will natively accept RF/FE, the vast majority of an ME network uses its own dedicated power system called AE. \\n \\n RF/FE can be converted into the native AE at a ratio of 2:1 RF:AE, either directly through an ME Controller, or through the &bEnergy Acceptor&f, which can instead be connected to any part of the network.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_cell": "By default, an ME network on its own only has an internal buffer of 800AE without an ME Controller, with the controller adding an extra 8kAE per block. For large enough networks, this can be insufficient and may cause a network to power off intermittently when trying to recoup power for any connected devices. \\n \\n The &bEnergy Cell&f allows for an ME network to hold significantly more energy, adding another 200kAE per regular Energy Cell and 1.6MAE per &bDense&f Energy Cell. These can also be placed anywhere in the network to provide the increased energy buffer.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_card": "The &bEnergy Card&f can be applied to most chargeable devices like Portable Cells and Wireless Terminals (covered later) to also increase &otheir&r energy buffer.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.meteorite": "Since we're missing the floor, finding where meteorites land is gonna be a little too hard so instead we've replaced them! \\n\\n Instead of finding Inscriber Press you can now craft them with an Inscriber. You'll need skystone dust for crafting them which we can get from sieving Dust. \\n\\n Don't worry they are still used the same as if ATM9 had floor.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.processors": "Once you have obtained a full set of the required &eInscriber Presses&r, it's time to start making some &eProcessors&f. These are an important crafting ingredient used to make the large majority of ME-connected devices.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.terminals": "&eTerminals&f provide access to any of the contents of an ME network. The standard &eME Terminal&f simply lists everything in the network as one large grid to pull from and insert into, akin to a single inventory. \\n \\n The &eME Crafting Terminal&f is an extension of the ME Terminal which also provides a built-in crafting grid, allowing for convenient crafting using any item contained in the network and visible through the terminal screen.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.network": "The &bNetwork Tool&f is an important tool throughout AE2, which is used to display various details of a network on-screen such as overall power consumption and storage. \\n \\n As an added bonus, it also provides its own small inventory used to hold &eupgrade cards&f, which can be accessed when looking at any upgradeable device's screen for easy replacement. However, it cannot rotate blocks attached to the ME network like a regular wrench, only dismantle them when sneaking.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fluix": "Arguably the most important resource you will need next is &eFluix&f, used throughout the vast majority of AE2 devices and serving as a base for crafting all of the cabling within an ME network. \\n \\n You'll typically want to mass produce these, and the way to do so is to make a &bFluix Crystal&f by throwing &eNether Quartz&f, &e&oCharged&r&e Certus quartz&r and &eRedstone&f together in a pool of water. This will give you a &eFluix Crystal&r which you can turn to dust in an Inscriber.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.cables": "To connect the vast majority of your ME network together, you will need some cable. &eME Glass Cable&f is the first and most basic kind of cable, and you'll be making this all throughout as the first step towards crafting the other kinds of cable. \\n \\n Both glass cables and their &ecovered&f counterpart can carry up to 8 channels along a single section of cabling. Unlike glass cables, covered cables can subsequently be crafted into &edense&f covered cables, capable of carrying up to 32 channels. However, most 'multipart' devices such as buses and terminals cannot be directly attached to dense cables, requiring normal-width cables to form a connection instead. \\n \\n All cables can also be crafted with dye to colour them. Uncoloured ('Fluix') cables can connect to any other colour of cable, but otherwise differently-coloured cables will never connect to one another.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.anchor": "The &bQuartz Cutting Knife&f, like the wrench, comes in both nether and certus quartz flavours and is a useful crafting tool to have on hand. \\n \\n Cables can also be separated without needing to be coloured by attaching a &bCable Anchor&f between them, crafted using this knife and craftable up to 50 times with the same knife before it breaks. \\n \\n Cable Anchors can also be used to craft &bCable Facades&f, allowing you to disguise cables within walls by covering them with the face of an arbitrary block. While facade recipes are hidden in JEI, you can still craft them by taking any regular block and surrounding it with 4 cable anchors in the crafting grid. \\n \\n Aside from crafting anchors, the cutting knife also has another use: right-clicking with the knife will open a small GUI that allows you to craft &bInscriber Name Presses&f. When given a name, these presses can be used inside of an Inscriber to rename any input item with the name of the press. Two of these presses can be concatenated in the inscriber to rename the item to the name of the top press, followed by the bottom one.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.advanced_cabling": "The &bME Smart Cable&f and &bDense Smart Cable&f function identically to the covered cables in terms of channel distribution, but will also visibly display the amount of channels they are using as coloured lines along themselves.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.coloring": "The &bColor Applicator&f is a chargeable tool that allows for in-world dyeing of cables. It functions more or less as a specialised &estorage cell&f to be loaded up with either vanilla dyes or &epaint balls&f for specific colours, along with &esnowballs&f to wash colours off and turn cables back to their Fluix variant. \\n \\n Applying colour to a cable uses 100AE of energy from its internal battery, for a total of 3400 cable segments in a single charge.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.channels": "In Applied Energistics 2, every ME network has a certain number of &echannels&f available, which simply means how many networked devices can fit on the whole network. \\n \\n As a rule of thumb, any device that more or less handles ME data directly (items stored within the network) and carries out some form of I/O will take up a channel. Usually components that are only concerned with the internal power storage of the network, like &eEnergy Cells&f and &eInscribers&f, do &onot&r take up channels. \\n \\n Networks without an &bME Controller&f are known as 'ad-hoc' networks and only support a maximum of 8 channels.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.ME_controller": "The last piece of the puzzle for any large ME network is the &bME Controller&f. \\n \\n A controller supplies an ME Network with a far larger number of channels than the standard 8 channels for ad-hoc networks, providing 32 channels out of each face of the block for a total of 216 channels. \\n \\n That's only for a single-block controller, however, since the ME Controller is in fact a multi-block structure. The controller can be up to 7x7x7 blocks in size and can come in any freeform arrangement within that maximum size. Each individual block can then provide its own separate set of channels, so long as no single controller block is surrounded by 4 other blocks along the same plane. \\n \\n An ME Network may only contain one multiblock controller at any given time. Attempting to connect more than one controller on separate parts of the network will cause a conflict, shutting down the whole network.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.storage": "Arguably the most important aspect of Applied Energistics 2 is its storage system, making use of digital &eStorage Cells&f. These cells are accessible through either an &eME Chest&r for single cells, or an &eME Drive&r for multiple cells. \\n \\n The &bME Chest&f holds a single Cell at a time, which can then be read from and written to from any other terminal on the same network. The ME Chest itself also provides its own terminal screen on the top with specific access only to the cell it contains. \\n \\n The &bME Drive&f can hold up to 10 assorted Storage Cells in the space of a single block and a single ME channel. However, it does not provide its own terminal screen, requiring some external terminal elsewhere on the network for storage access.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.MEIOPort": "The &bME IO Port&f allows for the contents of an ME network's storage to be quickly rearranged between different storage media such as ME cells and external containers connected to storage buses. \\n \\n When a cell is inserted in an input slot on the left, the IO Port can be toggled to either empty the cell out into other ME storages or fill the (ideally, partitioned) cell with certain items spread out across other storages.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.workbench": "The &bCell Workbench&f allows for cells to be 'partitioned' to hold specific items, i.e. given a whitelist filter. It also allows the cell to be upgraded with certain upgrade cards such as the Inverter Card, which sets the aforementioned whitelist to be a blacklist instead. \\n \\n Cells can also be given a higher or lower 'priority' via the workbench, i.e. allow the cell to be the first to receive certain items until full, or made to wait for other higher-priority cells to fill up first.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.equal_card": "The &bEqual Distribution Card&f is an upgrade for storage cells that pre-allocates a certain amount of items that can be taken up by any individual type. \\n \\n This behaviour is comparable to something like a Functional Storage drawer, wherein each compartment holds a set number of stacks as opposed to allowing items from one compartment to leak into the others and crowd other kinds of items out.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.overflow_card": "This behaviour is comparable to something like a Functional Storage drawer, wherein each compartment holds a set number of stacks as opposed to allowing items from one compartment to leak into the others and crowd other kinds of items out.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.1k": "Each individual cell has a certain capacity dictated by the &ecomponent&f that the cell has been crafted with. \\n \\n The first of the components is the &b1k ME Storage Component&f, providing &e1024&f 'bytes' of storage for a given cell. More on that later.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.4k": "The second tier of storage component, providing &e4096&f bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.16k": "The third tier of storage component, providing &e16384&f bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.64k": "The fourth tier of storage component, providing &e65536&f bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.256k": "The fifth and final AE2-standard tier of storage component, providing &e262144&f bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.1m": "There comes a point in any playthrough of a large modpack where even the highest standard tier of storage cell doesn't cut it for the amount of items and resources that you may be accumulating. \\n \\n This is where the &dMEGA Cells&f add-on comes in, extending the available tiers of storage into the megabyte territory. The first of these new tiers is given by the &b1M MEGA Storage Component&f, providing 1024 &okilo&rbytes, or &e1048576&f bytes, of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.4m": "The second MEGA tier of storage component, providing &e4194304&f (4096k) bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.16m": "The third MEGA tier of storage component, providing &e16777216&f (16384k) bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.64m": "The fourth MEGA tier of storage component, providing &e67108864&f (65536k) bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.256": "The fifth and final MEGA tier of storage component, providing &e268435456&f (262144k) bytes of storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.item_storage": "With the 1k Storage Component, you can now craft yourself a 1k ME Item Storage Cell to start your digital item storage system. You'll most likely want the majority of your storage to be for items, so you'll probably want to make a few &bME Item Storage Cells&f. \\n \\n ME Item Storage Cells can each hold up to 63 different types of items. Each new type of item added to a cell will take up a certain fraction of the storage cell's total capacity in bytes. For each type already present, 1 'byte' counts for 8 items of that same type. \\n \\n As an example, a 1k Item Storage Cell containing only cobblestone can hold up to 8128 cobblestone (8*1024b - 8b/type * 1 type). \\n \\n If a cell is empty, it can be repurposed by disassembling it into its respective component and housing. This is done by sneaking and right-clicking in the air with the cell in your hand.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.more_items": "Aside from DISKs, you can also use netherite to craft what is effectively the complete opposite of the DISK. \\n \\n &dMEGA Cells&f offers the bespoke &bBulk Item Storage Cell&f, which is limited to no more than &oone&r type of item storeable per cell but can store a practically &o&lINFINITE&r* number of that item type. Before it can accept an item type, it must be filtered in advance using a Cell Workbench. \\n \\n *&oTechnically 'max long'. If you know then you know.&r",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fluid": "Items are not the only things that can be stored in ME cells. &bME Fluid Storage Cells&f can store liquids such as water, lava and any variety of modded oils and fuels, just to give a few examples. \\n \\n Note that all storage cells, regardless of what they're designed to store, only differ in terms of their housing; both item and fluid cells use the same kind of storage component to make. \\n \\n For fluids, 1 byte equals 8 buckets (8000mb).",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.portable": "&bPortable Cells&f function identically to regular cells in that they can be inserted into a chest or drive and filled accordingly. \\n \\n However, unlike regular cells, their contents can also be accessed standalone via the cell item itself, a bit like a digital ME-flavoured backpack.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.weapons": "These last three items are more or less some extra toys provided by AE2 and don't necessarily fit under any of these quest trees. \\n \\n The &bCharged Staff&f is just a simple powered staff which deals 3 hearts of damage and consumes 300AE per hit. It also uses pre-1.9 combat mechanics, meaning that you can spam-click with this like in the good old days. \\n \\n The &bEntropy Manipulator&f, when &oused&r on certain blocks in the world, will smelt them in-place, such as sand to glass and metal ores to metal ingots. If not, it will simply light a fire on the block. \\n \\n Finally, the &bMatter Cannon&f functions similarly to the Color Applicator as a dedicated cell for holding 'ammo' items such as Matter Balls and iron/gold nuggets, which can then be fired out to deal damage to mobs or break blocks. Heavier 'ammo'Matter Balls in a Matter Cannon can be substituted with &bPaint Balls&f, which will apply a paint splatter effect on the face of whatever block being fired at. &bLumen Paint Balls&f are a variant of paint balls exclusively used by the Matter Cannon, whose paint splatters also give off some light once present in the world.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.autocrafting": "Storage is nice and all that, but what good is a storage system if it's clogged up with raw materials needing to be crafted and processed into something and you're still stuck with having to do so manually? \\n \\n AE2's &eauto-crafting&f system begins with the &bME Pattern Provider&f. The Pattern Provider holds certain items called &bPatterns&f (covered in the next quest) which are programmed to hold some recipe that turns input items into a certain output. Up to 9 patterns can fit in one provider. \\n \\n You'll often be making use of multiple pattern providers scattered all throughout your base, which is why it's useful to have a &bPattern Access Terminal&f to remotely access the contents of any and all providers on your wider ME network.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.growth": "Naturally, AE2 provides its own way to dramatically speed up crystal growth. \\n \\n Place these around your Budding Crystals, give them some power, and watch your crystals grow!",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.patterns": "&bPatterns&f are what hold an encoded recipe to be fulfilled by a Pattern Provider. To encode a recipe onto a Pattern, the &bME Pattern Encoding Terminal&f must be used. \\n \\n Patterns can be set to hold either a regular &ecrafting&f recipe, which will require the use of a &eMolecular Assembler&f on the face of its Provider, or a more general '&eprocessing&f' recipe, wherein any input items can be sent out by the provider into some other machine block or specialised processing plant.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.assembler": "The &bMolecular Assembler&f is AE2's equivalent of an automatic crafting table, required to fulfil any and all &ecrafting&f pattern jobs. \\n \\n Molecular Assemblers are capable of transferring power and channels to other ME devices connected to it, but will not themselves take up a channel. Up to 6 MAs can be connected to a single Pattern Provider (if employed) to allow for more crafts to be done in parallel. \\n \\n MAs also each have their own dedicated slot for a single crafting pattern, allowing them to function standalone when powered. When operated in this way, any matching items inserted into the MA will be automatically crafted into the result of the pattern.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.acceleration": "The &bAcceleration Card&f, depending on the device being upgraded with it, will either increase the speed at which the device operates or allow the device to carry out more operations in one go. \\n \\n In the case of the &eMolecular Assembler&f, a full set of 5 cards reduces the time taken for the MA to fulfil a craft from one second (with no cards) to one &otick&r.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.MElevel": "The &bME Level Emitter&f, when configured with a specific item and quantity of it to respond to, will emit a redstone signal depending on whether that item stored in the network either falls below, goes above or equals the given quantity. \\n \\n This can be used, for example, to automatically switch certain machines on with redstone to auto-craft a resource when it falls below a given minimum amount.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.redstoneME": "Individual ME devices can also be configured to respond to redstone signals. When upgraded with a &bRedstone Card&f, a device can be configured to do work only when powered with redstone or otherwise as needed. \\n \\n This behavior can also apply to entire &osections&r of an ME network by using an &bME Toggle Bus&f. This allows a section of the network on the other side of the bus to come online only when the bus is powered by redstone, or to go offline if using an &einverted&f toggle bus.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.crafting": "When applied as an upgrade to any supported device such as an Interface or Export Bus, the &bCrafting Card&f allows the device in question to automatically send out its own crafting requests for a required (filtered) item. Crafting CPUs can be set to respond only to these requests to prevent taking up CPUs meant for player-requested crafts. \\n \\n When the &eLevel Emitter&f is upgraded with the Crafting Card, it can be configured to emit redstone in order to directly facilitate in crafting, by emitting a signal either &owhile&r a crafting job for its given item is detected or specifically &oto&r craft the item. The latter would apply for cases where the only thing needed to make a given item is a redstone signal, without even requiring a crafting pattern.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.crafting_storage": "Before you can carry out an auto-crafting job, you need a device to actually store the request itself along with any interim items for multi-step crafts. This device is known as a &ecrafting CPU&f. \\n \\n A crafting CPU is a multiblock structure requiring at least one &bCrafting Storage&f block, optionally along with any other Crafting Unit. The multiblock can be made in any size, but must be a solid cuboid in order to form and function accordingly.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.crafting_coprocessor": "The &bCrafting Co-Processing Unit&f helps speed up crafting jobs by allowing pattern providers to either send items out to their connected devices faster or to work concurrently to make multiple required ingredients. \\n \\n The base AE2 co-processor provides one co-processor 'thread' to assist this, while the co-processing unit from &dMEGA Cells&f provides 4 threads in a single such block.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.crafting_monitor": "The &bCrafting Monitor&f displays the overall item being crafted, along with the remaining quantity of that item still being crafted. \\n \\n Both the base AE2 monitor and the MEGA monitor function identically, but are provided for aesthetic purposes.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.IO": "To make life that much easier, AE2 provides a whole suite of devices for the manipulation of ME data, i.e. moving stored items around the world. \\n \\n The &bME Interface&f is one of these devices. As an input device, the Interface allows any item/fluid/etc to be piped externally through it, which is then automatically stored in the ME Network that the interface is connected to. \\n \\n As an output device, the Interface can be configured to keep a certain available amount of a stored item in stock, from the ME network to its own internal inventory. This allows items to then be received by some external source like another player or some pipe.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.import_bus": "The &bME Import Bus&f periodically sucks items in from whatever external storage the bus is facing. It can optionally be filtered to only take in certain items from said inventory.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.annhilation_plane": "The &bME Annihilation Plane&f can be used to automatically break any blocks in front of it and return anything dropped by the block directly to the ME network. \\n \\n As an added bonus, the Annihilation Plane can be enchanted in the same way as a regular digging tool, affecting block drops in the same way as that enchanted tool would. This makes it ideal for processing ore blocks when enchanted with Fortune, for example. \\n Any added enchantments significantly increase the amount of energy used by the plane every time a block is broken. Enchanting the plane with &eEfficiency&f will decrease the overall energy use incurred by all other enchantments, while the &eUnbreaking&f enchantment gives the plane the chance to only use any energy sometimes, similarly to Unbreaking on regular tools.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.storage_bus": "The &bME Storage Bus&f, when facing some external storage container, will allow the container to be used as though it were part of the ME network, allowing items to be taken out from the container or inserted into it purely via ME. \\n \\n Storage buses can be filtered and given specific priorities such that specific items will try to go to the attached storage first, however it will not retroactively move any filtered items from anywhere else in the network to its attached storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.capacity": "The &bCapacity Card&f allows a bus upgraded with it to carry a larger filter. Import and Export buses upgraded with capacity cards can go from supporting only one filtered item each to their maximum nine-slot filter, while Storage buses will go from 18 slots to a maximum of 63.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.cards": "The &bFuzzy Card&f allows a filtered item to be matched regardless of any (NBT) metadata such as damage or enchantments, while the &bInverter Card&f toggles the filter on such buses from being a whitelist to being a blacklist.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.export_bus": "The &bME Export Bus&f periodically spits items in its whitelist filter out to whatever external storage the bus is facing. Unlike the Import Bus, the Export Bus cannot work without being filtered.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.formation_plane": "The &bME Formation Plane&f acts similarly to the Storage Bus, but treats the world itself as its storage medium. In other words, it will place down any block in its filter directly in front of itself. \\n \\n This can be useful for situations where a block can be processed simply by placing it and breaking it with a certain tool.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.P2P": "&bP2P&f (peer-to-peer) is a powerful system within AE2, allowing for the transfer of items, fluids and even more without the need for any intermediary ME storage. \\n \\n Right-clicking on a P2P tunnel with certain items will &eattune&f the tunnel into one capable of transferring something else, such as items through pipes, energy through cables, redstone signals and (by default) even ME connections themselves. \\n \\n P2P tunnels must be linked to one another with the use of a &eMemory Card&f, detailed in the next quest.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.memory": "The &bMemory Card&f is a tool with two different functions. The simplest of the two is to save various devices' configurations (such as whitelist filters) to be copied over to another device of the same kind. \\n \\n The second function of a memory card is to link &eP2P tunnels&f together. When doing so, the P2P tunnel being linked will be assigned a unique ID, which is stored on the memory card for further linking.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fiber": "An important concept within AE2 is a technique known as '&esubnetting&f', wherein an extra separate ME network (a &esubnetwork&f) acts in conjunction with the main network to perform some specialised function or process. \\n \\n What separates a subnetwork from a completely detached separate network is usually the use of the &bQuartz Fiber&f as a cable part. When placed between two otherwise unconnected lengths of cable, the Quartz Fiber transfers no data or channels between the two whatsoever, instead only transmitting power. \\n \\n Thus, a subnetwork on the other side of the Fiber can be powered wholly by the main network's power source, without requiring any extra dedicated powergen.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.spatial": "Aside from the storage of items and fluids, AE2 also provides a native way of storing entire &estructures&f inside of storage cells, not too dissimilarly to the Compact Machines mod. \\n \\n The &bSpatial IO Port&f allows structures contained within a &bSpatial Containment Structure&f to be captured within a specially-designed storage cell, activated via a redstone signal. \\n \\n If a mob or player happens to stand inside of the SCS while the space is being captured, they too will be transported to where the rest of the space goes, i.e. in a dedicated dimension. Just make sure you have a way to get back out and in if you're the one being captured.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.pylon": "The Spatial Containment Structure (SCS) consists of a cage of &bSpatial Pylons&f covering the volume you wish to enclose in a Spatial IO cell. At the absolute minimum, an SCS requires three lines of spatial pylon blocks, one for each dimension of the space being contained (length, width, height). \\n \\n However, Spatial IO is an extremely power-hungry feature, especially when trying to capture much larger spaces (up to 128x128x128). Having more spatial pylons included in the SCS around the desired volume will increase its overall &eefficiency&f, allowing it to use less energy to capture. \\n \\n Also, be mindful that each individual pylon (regardless of its length) takes up one channel. For particularly large spaces, you may wish to build a dedicated network with a controller to fit all the required pylons.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.SSC": "&bSpatial Storage Cells&f are used to hold one defined volume each, and come in three different capacities allowing for a maximum of 2x2x2, 16x16x16 and 128x128x128 blocks' worth of space. \\n \\n Upon encoding, a cell is allocated a section of space within the spatial storage &edimension&f, along with a unique ID corresponding to the region allocated to the cell. An encoded cell can still be used within the Spatial IO Port to retrieve any stored blocks and entities. \\n \\n From then on, any blocks contained either within the cell's region of space or in an SCS with the same size as the one used for the initial encoding can be moved back into the overworld or into the spatial dimension respectively. If there are blocks both within the spatial region and within the SCS, these will simply swap places accordingly.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.Sanchor": "The &bSpatial Anchor&f is a companion device from the Spatial IO lineage that simply functions as a chunk loader. When connected to an ME network, the Anchor will force-load all the chunks occupied by the ME network across all cables and devices, excluding subnetworks, as long as the network remains powered.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.wireless_AP": "The next thing to make to allow for wireless network access is the &bME Wireless Access Point&f. The Access Point is used to open the network to wireless access via a &ewireless terminal&f, and has a set (finite) range depending on how many &bWireless Boosters&f are inserted into the access point.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.wireless_terminal": "The &bWireless Terminal&f functions identically to a regular terminal, but wirelessly. \\n \\n Before it can be used to access a network, it must first be &elinked&f to the network by placing it into the top-right slot of the &eWireless Access Point&r. If it is not linked to a network, or is out of either range or power, the terminal will not function. \\n \\n Wireless terminals can also be upgraded with &eEnergy Cards&f to provide a larger internal battery.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.quantumbridge": "To get infinite range with your wireless terminal, you need a quantum bridge card. First build a quantum ring, then add the quantum bridge card to your wireless terminal, and a singularity to both the quantum ring and your wireless terminal.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.matter": "As for wirelessly expanding the ME Network itself, the first step is admittedly somewhat unorthodox. \\n \\n The &bMatter Condenser&f is AE2's take on a trash can, voiding any items inserted into it. When fitted with a &eStorage Component&f, however, the condenser can harness some left-over energy from the item being voided and store it to make two special crafting items out of enough concentrated energy. \\n \\n The first of these two items is the &bMatter Ball&f, requiring at least a 1k storage component and 256 items' worth of voided material.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.antimatter": "When using a 64k storage component or higher, the Matter Condenser becomes able to condense significantly more to produce a &bSingularity&f. A single singularity requires 256000 items to be voided. That's exactly &o4000 stacks&r! \\n \\n See what happens when you throw this singularity on the ground with a piece of &eender dust&f. You'll have to deal some damage to the surroundings while you're at it, but thankfully AE2 offers its own &bTiny TNT&f to minimise that.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.quantum": "If you did that last quest correctly, you should have turned that singularity into a pair of &bQuantum Entangled Singularities&f. These new singularities are used to link together a ring-shaped device known as a &eQuantum Network Bridge&f. \\n \\n When two of these individual rings have been linked using the Quantum Entangled Singularities and jumpstarted with some AE power (e.g. an energy cell), an ME network can be expanded wirelessly on the other side of the bridge, across either long distances or even dimensions.",

The Core is where recipes can be autoplaced in from JEI, where the middle item goes, and where the end item will be put. It will need the Injectors put a few blocks away from it looking toward the Core on two sides of it. Check next Quest to find more on those. The Injectors will also need Energy which will be explained more in the Crystal Binding Quest.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.basic": "Fusion Crafting has Tiers which is determined by the Injectors. The Tiers go in ascending order: Draconium (I refer to it as Basic to help differentiate), Wyvern, Draconic, and Chaotic.

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.prep": "Now before you get to the Chaos Island I recommend preparing, he may look like the Ender Dragon but this one is much more difficult. You'll want Draconic Weapons or Tools that do a lot of damage as those will make it easier. He will also do a crap-ton of damage good Armor like Unobtainium or Meka-Suit will be recommeneded. (Also effects of Regeneration, Absorption, and Resistance will help you survive}. Don't wprry you can always come back to fight another day if you aren't ready.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.destroy": "The first stage of the fight involves breaking the Crystals that hold the Chaos Guardians Shield. You can't hurt him until they are destroyed. Destroying these crystals is no easy task without a Draconic weapon. Chaos Guardian fire balls can weaken this shield allowing you to destroy it. (Yes, he will need too shoot at you/hitting the crystals). You'll notice particles being produced when it's vulnerable to damages and when hit will make a noise. The closer to destruction the deeper the noise and dimmer the Crystal will get. Once they are destroyed you can finally damage him!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.guardian": "Now the actual fight starts, he has two health bars both need to get taken to 0 to get the Chaos Shards. Don't get too close or he'll hit you with a barrage of Fireballs! {BTW in older versions the Chaos Guardian could even kill someone in Creative mode! Fortunately it can't anymore)",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.shard": "Once defeated he'll drop EXP, a Dragon Heart, and most importantly free the Chaos Shards. Look to where Lightning will strike then mine below it. There you will find the Chaos Shard. Mine it to be granted 5 Chaos Shards which can be crafted into smaller parts of it!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.module": "Modules are very important to our DE items. So important they don't work without them! Most Modules are made from a Module Core or a previous Module. Hold an item and press Shift and C to open the Module Menu. There you'll see some slots and buttons! The Slots are where Modules will actually go and the Grid is what determines how many Modules can go. When a Module says 1x1 it'll only take 1 Slot, while one that says 2z2 will take uo 4 slots. The lowest button on the right will show what Modules can be applied to the Item you are holding. The rest just change the look of GUI.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BEnM": "Energy Modules are the most important Modules and are needed for using DE items. The amount in them determines how much OP an item can hold and take in, check out the Energy Infuser to learn more about charging. The later the Tier of Energy Module the more OP items can hold and use. This is important as when items are upgraded they use more OP per use.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WEnL": "Wireless Energy Links help to make it so Wireless Crystals can charge your items. The more modules, the more OP it can take it and at a better rate.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.QEnT": "The better the Energy Link or Tunnel obviously the more OP it can transfer, but also you might have noticed sonething missing with the Energy Link. It doesn't work between Dimensions! Thankfully the better ones can, just make sure the other side is chunkloaded.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BSpM": "Speed Modules are fun, they work in just about everything and make them faster! Swords swing faster, Pickaxes mine faster, Axes chop faster, Bows shoot faster, and Chestplate makes you faster. The better the Speed Module the faster they go! (BTW good time to mention most stats stack up. 2 Basic Speed Modules increase Speed by 20%% then!)",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPDaM": "These Modules are only for the DE Bows, unlike the previous ones. The Projectile Damage Module increases the damage of Arrows shot by the Bow. Some Modules happen to have negative effects with it, like these give a slight more Inaccuracy to Bows. All of these can stack!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPVeM": "Velocity is the speed of an item at a certain direction. Since our Arrow aren't from Guardians of the Galaxy it basically just means the Speed of an Arrow. With each upgrade it takes less time from the Arrow to go from your Bow to your Target. Comes at a cost of a little inaccuracy.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.PICaM": "Thanks to Newton we know for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Basically when an Arrow hits a mob the force of the Mob applies to the Arrow which will slow it down. Unless you have this Module. It doesn't act as if every mob was paper, it acts as if every mob isn't in the way. Arrows won't slow down after Piercing a target.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPPeM": "If you haven't played Minecraft since 1.13 this might confuse you, but you know Crossbows and Piercing. They have an enchantment which allows their Arrows to go through multiple targets and continuously dealing damage. This Module does exactly that!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPAcM": "With something so primitive as a Bow you can't expect perfect Accuracy. Well you can if you use these Modules. The Arrow is much more likely to hit its target and not go off course.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.AFiM": "Most Bows are Semi-Automatic. You have to draw the string, release, and put another Arrow in the bow, and repeat. Instead skip all that let the Bow automatically fire everytime it's fully drawn. Just hold Right Click and watch it go!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPGrCM": "What is up with Physics and De and betraying them? Gravity pulls the Arrow down over the time it's shot. Gravity Compensation makes us worry less about that.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BAOEM": "Area of Effect is a phrase most Gamers would know. Basically it upgrades the working area of the Tool it's on. Pickaxes with 3x3 AOE will mine in a 3x3 area. Swords with 3x3 AOE will kill all mobs hit within that area. The better the upgrade the bigger the area. No, it's not stackable!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.ECoM": "Items gotten from the Tool this is on will go to your Ender Chest. The Minecraft one not modded one.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.FECoM": "Same deal but with options of filtering.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.SInM": "Filtering isn't enough?!?! You want the items destroyed?!?! You monster!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BDM": "Pretty simple premise, Axes and Swords can do more Damage. Yes, it stacks!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WTrH": "All Trees attached to whats chopped down, comes with it.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WUnM": "Undying acts as the thing that makes it, the Recovery Totem! When your hearts are down to 0 instead of dying the Module will activate, giving you Absorption and Regeneration, saving your life. It has a Cooldown and needs to use OP to power up again. Try not to die during that time! Better upgrades means less cooldowns.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSCaM": "Chestplates work similar to the Meka-Suit. Any damage that would be dealt to you is negated and instead taken off your Shield. Shield capacity is how much Shield you can hold, recharge rate is how fast it fills up, and OP will be used when recharging.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WLSCaM": "Same as the previous quest, just more, a lot more.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSReM": "Want your Shield to come back and not just when you almost die? Then, you'll need Recovery Modules. The more Modules the faster it recovers.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.NVM": "Unless you're a little cheater who uses Night Vision Texture Packs, you might find the dark a little worry some. Thankfully Night Vision Module in a DE Chestplate helps get over the fear of not being able to see in the dark. Not the fear of what's in the dark though...",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSCoM": "Shield Control changes the actual Shielf you have and when it regenerates.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.AAM": "Water is a little viscous, or atleast more dense than air. Because of that Mining Underwater is slower. You can use the Enchantment of Aqua Affinity, or use this Module. Your choice!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WFlM": "With this on your Chestplate you can Glide! As if you were using an Elytra (But without cost of Armor). I don't like to call it flying, rather 'falling with style'.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.DFlM": "Okay now this ones give both Gliding and actual Flying, Creative Flight to be more exact.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.MSM": "When 'falling' your Mining is slowed down. That includes when creative flying or even bouncing in water. Thankfully you can use Air Affinty Enchantment to negate that! Not a vanilla Enchantment but still helpful! Oh wait I was supposed to talk about the Module... same thing!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BJuM": "Legit just Jump Boost.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.HSM": "Basically it turns auto-jump on. Personally I like it but it's up to you to use it!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BAFeM": "Auto-Feed will automatically feed you any food in your Inventory when hungry. It has a max Food Point storage though, each full bar is 2 Food Points. So the Basic one can only hold 8 Steaks worth.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.binder": "Operational Potentional is the Energy source of Draconic Evolution. The main way (not the only way) of moving OP is with IO Relay Crystals. To actually get OP into items you'll need an Energy Transfer.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.IO": "The IO Crystals work as blocks that can connect to each other and move power from one another. To link them Shift Right Click with a Crystal Binder to set one and then right click whichever Crystal you want connected. When you look at the Crystal it will say either Input from block or Output to block. Input is the one you want to take OP from and Output to where you want it to go.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.transfuser": "Before you get here first you need an item that needs OP in it: Wyvern Bow, Chaotic Capacitor, Staff of Power whatever. Then you need an Energy Module in the item, that determines the OP storage in the item and that's what the item will use to power up. Once you have that, make and place the Energy Transfuser, get OP in it, then place your item into it! You'll know it's working when the OP in it lights up and moves.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.core": "The Energy Core is one, if not the, greatest Energy bank in all of Minecraft. And it all starts with the Core. This is the middle and heart of the Energy Core Multiblock (make sure it's a bit off the ground). When you place it down you can see it's GUI with the: Build Guide, Tier Down, Tier Up, and Assemble Core. The Tiers determine how big and powerful the Core is. The Build Guide shows you how to assemble this Tier of Core. If you have all the blocks necessary you can press Assemble Core and it will automatically make it!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.pylon": "Pylons are how you get OP in and out of the Energy Core. Place them atleast close to the Core, 2 of them 1 for input and 1 for output (you can use more). Then, place Glass over them and they will be assembled automatically targeting the closest Energy Core. Right Click the newly formed balls ontop of the Pylons to change whether they are Input or Output (you'll know from the arrows and design of them). Then, you can attach Crystals to them to move OP in and out!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.stabilizer": "Energy Core Stabilizers... stabilize? The Core. For the first 4 Tiers of Cores you need only 4 Stabilizers around it. You can access the GUi of the Core through the Stabilizers as well. If they are placed too close to the Core or in the wrong spots it will tell you it's incorrect.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.1": "Tier 1 only needs the Core and 4 Stabilizers to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.2": "Tier 2 needs 6 Draconium Ingot Blocks, 1 on each side of the Core. Then, obviously the 4 Stabilizers to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.3": "Tier 3 needs 26 Draconium Ingot Blocks around it, fully encasing the Core, to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.4": "Tier 4 is different. First, it needs 26 Redstone Blocks encasing the Core. Then above the Redstone it needs 56 Draconium Ingot Blocks.",

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.more_pylons": "Technically this is optional but recommended! You can use more Pylons to take in and out more OP!",

Once Containment Shield is down to 0 while Reactor is turned on it will begin a Meltdown.

The Bars go from left to right: Heat, Containment Field, Energy Saturation, and Fuel Conversion. You already learned about the Field and Energy and you will learn about the Fuel in a next quest. So the Heat is pretty important as when warming up it will raise to 2000C before being ready to activate. Make sure it doesn't get too high or else... meltdown! The Ball is the image of your Core, right now I have a bug where the Core doesn't have a texture so I can't explain much. The Buttons change the appearance of GUI, to activate or shutdown the Reactor, and charge it.",

(BTW 1 RF = 1 OP) They need Redstone to activate and can be used for both adding OP and taking out OP. You'll need Energy out to not Meltdown, try putting it in an Energy Core!",

	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.arcana": "&5Arcana&r is very important quantity, it increases the amount of Enchantments you get and makes rare Enchantments more common. An example would be like with Swords, smite is a very common enchantment but looting is much more rare. &5Arcanas&r default is &50%%&r and max is &5100%%&r.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.quanta": "&cQuanta&r sets how random the Enchants you get will be. It can be used against you though depending on &eRectification&r.

One way you can do this is with &d5 Draconic Endshelves&r, &46 Glowing Hellshelves&r, &41 Blazing Hellshelves&r, &b1 Heart-Forged Seashelf&r, and 2 Melonshelves. {BTW I used any curios charm tag so some items that can be used in the quest can not be made Unbreakable, only Apotheosis Charms can.)",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.trident": "Apotheosis knows how annoying Tridents can be to get so they made it easier... well kinda easier.

	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.alexandria": "The Library of Alexandria is a better Enchantment Library. It can hold more, that's it. you need to Infuse a Enchantment Library.

	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.glowing": "The &4Glowing Hellshelf&r is an upgrade to the &4Infused Hellshelf&r. It also increases the Max &aEterna&r but it's not the stats we're looking for in order to Enchant. Definitely good for normal Enchanting though!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.crystalline": "The &bCrystalline Seashelf&r is an upgrade to the &bInfused Seashelf&r. It's very good for normal Enchantments but doesn't give us enough &5Arcana&r for the next Infusion we'll need. Still good stats for normal Enchanting though!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.heart-forged": "The &bHeart-Forged Seashelf&r is another upgrade to the &bInfused Seashelf&r. It's a little expensive but gives the &5Arcana&r we'll need for Infusion and later Enchanting. The negative &eRectification&r makes it a little worse for normal Enchanting though as it's important for getting good Enchantments.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.deepshelf": "The &1Deepshelf&r (not dormant) is your next step to Enchanting. Like everything else it needs Infusion. The &1Deepshelf&r needs 30 &aEterna&r, &c40%% Quanta&r, and &540%% Arcana&r. You can get that with &45 Blazing Hellshelves&r and &b4 Heart-Forged Seashelves&r.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_deep": "Like an improved &4Hellshelf&r, the &1Soul Touched Deepshelf&r gives a lot of &cQuanta&r, it does give higher &aEterna&r max to &a37.5&r though! Which means better Enchants!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_sculk": "Suprisingly you don't need infusion for these! You just need to kill the most powerful boss in vanilla Minecraft! The &1Skulk shelves&r increase &aEterna&r to &a40&r which will allow us to Infuse the next item.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.echo_deep": "A little expensive but the &1Echoing Deep Shelf&r is like a much better &bSeashelf&r. (BTW you'll need to kill quite a few wardens to advance more in Enchanting... shoulda warned you earlier). Also increases Max &aEterna&r to &a37.5&r.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.echo_sculk": "You might need to kill a few Wardens for these but that's okay Apotheosis makes it easier! This shelf is mostly for &5Arcana&r but it's a good source for all quantities. It will be needed for next Infusion.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.endshelf": "The last sets of Shelves you'll need are &dEndshelves&r, to get them you need Infused Dragon's Breath. This one was hard to get but you need atleast &a40%% Eterna&r, &c15%%-25%% Quanta&r, and atleast &560%% Arcana&r. It has to be between &c15%%-25%% Quanta&r to get that you can try &19 Echoing Skulkshelves&r and 4 Melonshelves or &12 Echoing Skulkshelves&r and &410 Heart-Forged Seashelves&r.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.pearlescent": "The &dPearlescent Endshelf&r is the best all-around shelf. It also gives a Max &aEterna&r of &a45&r, but this isn't the shelf we're looking for to get perfect set up.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.draconic": "The &dDraconic Shelf&r is the last Shelf we'll need for perfect set up. It might only give &aEterna&r but it has the Max Max &aEterna&r of &a50&r.",

Then the Bottle O' Enchanting can be used to Infuse with a Book for Experience Tome. The Experience Tome can be used with Right Click to Store EXP or can be crafted with a Force Rod to make an Upgrade Core.
