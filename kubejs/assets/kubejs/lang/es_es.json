Just like Amethyst, you will find Certus Quartz Crystals that you can mine for Certus Quartz &eDust&f and &eCrystals&f. \\n \\n For more information on AE2 beyond this chapter, consult the wiki over at",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.wrench": "The &bQuartz Wrench&f does what any regular tech mod wrench would do. It rotates blocks and devices along the face you right-click on and dismantles them when right-clicked while sneaking. \\n \\n AE2's wrench comes in both certus and nether quartz flavours.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.first": "Two of the very first things you will need to get started in AE2 are the &bCharger&f and the &bInscriber&f. \\n \\n The &bCharger&f, when supplied with power, will take &eCertus Quartz Crystals&r and charge them. These &eCharged Certus Crystals&r can then be used in the production of &eFluix&f, another important resource in the mod. It can also be used to charge any item that stores power. \\n \\n The &bInscriber&f can be used to turn the various quartz crystals in AE2 into their dust form, but more importantly is used to fabricate special &ePrinted Circuits&f and &eProcessors&f, as will become clearer in the next quest.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_acceptor": "While the Inscriber and Charger will natively accept RF/FE, the vast majority of an ME network uses its own dedicated power system called AE. \\n \\n RF/FE can be converted into the native AE at a ratio of 2:1 RF:AE, either directly through an ME Controller, or through the &bEnergy Acceptor&f, which can instead be connected to any part of the network.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_cell": "By default, an ME network on its own only has an internal buffer of 800AE without an ME Controller, with the controller adding an extra 8kAE per block. For large enough networks, this can be insufficient and may cause a network to power off intermittently when trying to recoup power for any connected devices. \\n \\n The &bEnergy Cell&f allows for an ME network to hold significantly more energy, adding another 200kAE per regular Energy Cell and 1.6MAE per &bDense&f Energy Cell. These can also be placed anywhere in the network to provide the increased energy buffer.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_card": "The &bEnergy Card&f can be applied to most chargeable devices like Portable Cells and Wireless Terminals (covered later) to also increase &otheir&r energy buffer.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.meteorite": "It is time to find &eMeteorites&f that contain &bSky Stone&f. These can be either on the surface or underground, and contain a &bMysterious Cube&f in its center. \\n \\n This cube contains all of the different &ePresses&f used in the Inscriber to make AE2's special crafting components. \\n \\n The easiest way to locate a meteorite is by crafting a &eMeteorite Compass&r by placing a compass inside of a Charger.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.processors": "Once you have obtained a full set of the required &eInscriber Presses&r, it's time to start making some &eProcessors&f. These are an important crafting ingredient used to make the large majority of ME-connected devices.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.terminals": "&eTerminals&f provide access to any of the contents of an ME network. The standard &eME Terminal&f simply lists everything in the network as one large grid to pull from and insert into, akin to a single inventory. \\n \\n The &eME Crafting Terminal&f is an extension of the ME Terminal which also provides a built-in crafting grid, allowing for convenient crafting using any item contained in the network and visible through the terminal screen.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.network": "The &bNetwork Tool&f is an important tool throughout AE2, which is used to display various details of a network on-screen such as overall power consumption and storage. \\n \\n As an added bonus, it also provides its own small inventory used to hold &eupgrade cards&f, which can be accessed when looking at any upgradeable device's screen for easy replacement. However, it cannot rotate blocks attached to the ME network like a regular wrench, only dismantle them when sneaking.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fluix": "Arguably the most important resource you will need next is &eFluix&f, used throughout the vast majority of AE2 devices and serving as a base for crafting all of the cabling within an ME network. \\n \\n You'll typically want to mass produce these, and the way to do so is to make a &bFluix Crystal&f by throwing &eNether Quartz&f, &e&oCharged&r&e Certus quartz&r and &eRedstone&f together in a pool of water. This will give you a &eFluix Crystal&r which you can turn to dust in an Inscriber.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.cables": "To connect the vast majority of your ME network together, you will need some cable. &eME Glass Cable&f is the first and most basic kind of cable, and you'll be making this all throughout as the first step towards crafting the other kinds of cable. \\n \\n Both glass cables and their &ecovered&f counterpart can carry up to 8 channels along a single section of cabling. Unlike glass cables, covered cables can subsequently be crafted into &edense&f covered cables, capable of carrying up to 32 channels. However, most 'multipart' devices such as buses and terminals cannot be directly attached to dense cables, requiring normal-width cables to form a connection instead. \\n \\n All cables can also be crafted with dye to colour them. Uncoloured ('Fluix') cables can connect to any other colour of cable, but otherwise differently-coloured cables will never connect to one another.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.anchor": "The &bQuartz Cutting Knife&f, like the wrench, comes in both nether and certus quartz flavours and is a useful crafting tool to have on hand. \\n \\n Cables can also be separated without needing to be coloured by attaching a &bCable Anchor&f between them, crafted using this knife and craftable up to 50 times with the same knife before it breaks. \\n \\n Cable Anchors can also be used to craft &bCable Facades&f, allowing you to disguise cables within walls by covering them with the face of an arbitrary block. While facade recipes are hidden in JEI, you can still craft them by taking any regular block and surrounding it with 4 cable anchors in the crafting grid. \\n \\n Aside from crafting anchors, the cutting knife also has another use: right-clicking with the knife will open a small GUI that allows you to craft &bInscriber Name Presses&f. When given a name, these presses can be used inside of an Inscriber to rename any input item with the name of the press. Two of these presses can be concatenated in the inscriber to rename the item to the name of the top press, followed by the bottom one.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.advanced_cabling": "The &bME Smart Cable&f and &bDense Smart Cable&f function identically to the covered cables in terms of channel distribution, but will also visibly display the amount of channels they are using as coloured lines along themselves.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.coloring": "The &bColor Applicator&f is a chargeable tool that allows for in-world dyeing of cables. It functions more or less as a specialised &estorage cell&f to be loaded up with either vanilla dyes or &epaint balls&f for specific colours, along with &esnowballs&f to wash colours off and turn cables back to their Fluix variant. \\n \\n Applying colour to a cable uses 100AE of energy from its internal battery, for a total of 3400 cable segments in a single charge.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.channels": "In Applied Energistics 2, every ME network has a certain number of &echannels&f available, which simply means how many networked devices can fit on the whole network. \\n \\n As a rule of thumb, any device that more or less handles ME data directly (items stored within the network) and carries out some form of I/O will take up a channel. Usually components that are only concerned with the internal power storage of the network, like &eEnergy Cells&f and &eInscribers&f, do &onot&r take up channels. \\n \\n Networks without an &bME Controller&f are known as 'ad-hoc' networks and only support a maximum of 8 channels.",

The controller can be up to 7x7x7 blocks in size and can come in any freeform arrangement within that maximum size. Each individual block can then provide its own separate set of channels, so long as no single controller block is surrounded by 4 other blocks along the same plane. \\n \\n An ME Network may only contain one multiblock controller at any given time.

As an input device, the Interface allows any item/fluid/etc to be piped externally through it, which is then automatically stored in the ME Network that the interface is connected to. \\n \\n As an output device, the Interface can be configured to keep a certain available amount of a stored item in stock, from the ME network to its own internal inventory. This allows items to then be received by some external source like another player or some pipe.",

This makes it ideal for processing ore blocks when enchanted with Fortune, for example. \\n Any added enchantments significantly increase the amount of energy used by the plane every time a block is broken. Enchanting the plane with &eEfficiency&f will decrease the overall energy use incurred by all other enchantments, while the &eUnbreaking&f enchantment gives the plane the chance to only use any energy sometimes, similarly to Unbreaking on regular tools.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.storage_bus": "The &bME Storage Bus&f, when facing some external storage container, will allow the container to be used as though it were part of the ME network, allowing items to be taken out from the container or inserted into it purely via ME. \\n \\n Storage buses can be filtered and given specific priorities such that specific items will try to go to the attached storage first, however it will not retroactively move any filtered items from anywhere else in the network to its attached storage.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.capacity": "The &bCapacity Card&f allows a bus upgraded with it to carry a larger filter. Import and Export buses upgraded with capacity cards can go from supporting only one filtered item each to their maximum nine-slot filter, while Storage buses will go from 18 slots to a maximum of 63.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.cards": "The &bFuzzy Card&f allows a filtered item to be matched regardless of any (NBT) metadata such as damage or enchantments, while the &bInverter Card&f toggles the filter on such buses from being a whitelist to being a blacklist.",

	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.memory": "The &bMemory Card&f is a tool with two different functions. The simplest of the two is to save various devices' configurations (such as whitelist filters) to be copied over to another device of the same kind. \\n \\n The second function of a memory card is to link &eP2P tunnels&f together. When doing so, the P2P tunnel being linked will be assigned a unique ID, which is stored on the memory card for further linking.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fiber": "An important concept within AE2 is a technique known as '&esubnetting&f', wherein an extra separate ME network (a &esubnetwork&f) acts in conjunction with the main network to perform some specialised function or process. \\n \\n What separates a subnetwork from a completely detached separate network is usually the use of the &bQuartz Fiber&f as a cable part. When placed between two otherwise unconnected lengths of cable, the Quartz Fiber transfers no data or channels between the two whatsoever, instead only transmitting power. \\n \\n Thus, a subnetwork on the other side of the Fiber can be powered wholly by the main network's power source, without requiring any extra dedicated powergen.",

Having more spatial pylons included in the SCS around the desired volume will increase its overall &eefficiency&f, allowing it to use less energy to capture. \\n \\n Also, be mindful that each individual pylon (regardless of its length) takes up one channel. For particularly large spaces, you may wish to build a dedicated network with a controller to fit all the required pylons.",

An encoded cell can still be used within the Spatial IO Port to retrieve any stored blocks and entities. \\n \\n From then on, any blocks contained either within the cell's region of space or in an SCS with the same size as the one used for the initial encoding can be moved back into the overworld or into the spatial dimension respectively.

Once you beat his health halfway he will start stage 2. At stage 2 he will change colors to a light blue and will get many more attacks with his sword and shield.

Once you beat it down half way it's helmet will break exposing it's real head and starting the 2nd stage. To start he will break the floor of the arena exposing the floor below, then he will use the same moves while pulling you closer. (Also he is immune to arrows so I hope you have a good sword!).

The grapple does similar but will latch on to whatever is in range and pull you toward it. There's no durability so enjoy it forever!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.egg": "The Abyssal Egg is also a drop from &5The Leviathan&r, because apparently you killed a pregnant one.

You can tame it by feeding it a Sniffer Egg then it will act like a dog. Attacking what attacks you or what you attack. It also has 3 modes: follow, wander, and stay. Follow it will... well follow you. Wander will have it walking around a certain area. And stay will have it lay down in one spot. Enjoy your new dino!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.sandstorm": "Sandstorm in a bottle is an item you wear for a special effect. It goes in the Belt slot and when you press default X you will turn into a sandstorm.

	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.gauntlet": "The Gauntlet of Guard is more of a tool than a weapon, it brings in mobs closer when you hold right click with it. Then you can smack the enemies with it to do a bit of damage.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.gatling": "The Gatling Laser is a weapon you can make from Witherite. By using Redstone in your inventory you can shoot lasers which start fires and do damage. It shoots 50 lasers per 1 redstone which I think is a good deal.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.meat": "The Meat Shredder is a Melee weapon you can make from Witherite. It has two attacks, tapping left click and holding it. When you tap left click it'll use the Meat Shredder like an Axe, hitting them once from a decent range. When you hold it though it will repeatedly shred them with it's saw doing much quicker damage from closer.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.WASW": "The Wither Assault Shoulder Weapon (W.A.S.W.) is the last weapon you can make from Witherite. It has 2 different projectiles it can shoot: Wither Missiles and Wither Howitzers. The Wither Missiles shoot from just holding right click, and will damage whatever hit them with low cooldown. The Wither Howitzers are fired when you shift hold right click, they damage a bigger area and leave an area of wither effect that damages whatever walks in it. They have much longer cooldown though.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.bulwark": "You like the &bIgnis'&r shield? Well you can make 1 of your own with Ignitium. The Bulwark of the Flame can be used like a normal shield but also has a special effect. When holding right click and shift, letting go will let you charge at whatever is infront of you, like how goats do. Whatever gets hit will take damage and if pinched against a wall will also get stunned. Definitely nice to have around!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.incinerator": "My personal favorite and one of the most powerful. The Incinerator can be used just like a normal sword and enchanted like one. But when holding right click it does something no normal sword does. When you hold and let go of right click for a few seconds, massive flames will strike out of the ground in the direction you are looking at then will explode.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.anvil": "The Mechanical Fusion Anvil will be needed to make the void and fused weapons. It places like a normal anvil but does not have durability.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.VASW": "The Void Assault Shoulder Weapon (V.A.S.W.) is just like the Wither version but better. Now it only shoots Void Howitzers which will do more damage and cause void runes to come out of the ground in the area the Howitzer hit. Just at the cost of the long cooldown, but we've got time to wait. It can crafted by combining the WASW and a Void Core in the Mechanical Infusion Anvil.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.VForge": "The Void Forge is not much different from the Infernal Forge. Same attack damage and speed, same pickaxe tier, just summons Void Runes when attacking. Can be crafted by combining an Infernal Forge and a Void Core in a Mechanical Fusion Anvil.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.GoB": "The Gauntlet of Bulwark acts not as you'd assume. Instead of bringing mobs closer it pushes them away, when holding right click, and gives them Blazing Brand. Then when you release right click you'll do the normal charge. It's made by fusing the Gauntlet of Guard with a Bulwark of Flame in the Mechanical Fusion Anvil.",
